# About

A playground for a developer to see all changes using NuGet package [CompareNETObjects](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CompareNETObjects/4.83.0?_src=template) for experimenting.

---

`CompareNETObjects` has been around for a long time and is a great library for comparing objects. It has a lot of features and is very flexible. It can be used to compare objects of different types, and it can also be used to compare objects that are not the same type but have similar properties.
